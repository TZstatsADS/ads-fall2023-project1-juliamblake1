### [Project Description](doc/Proj1_desc.md)
This is the first and only *individual* (as opposed to *team*) this semester. 

Term: Fall 2023

+ Projec title: What makes men and women happy?
+ This project is conducted by Julia Blake

+ Project summary: In a world constantly bustling with activity and marked by a never-ending pursuit of success and fulfillment, there's one elusive treasure that stands above all else: happiness. What is happiness, and how do we find it? This timeless question has intrigued philosophers, psychologists, and ordinary individuals alike for centuries. It's a quest that transcends cultural boundaries and societal norms, and it's a journey that we embark upon from the moment we're born.

But what exactly is the essence of happiness? Is it found in material wealth, in relationships, or in the pursuit of personal goals and dreams? Can it be quantified and measured, or is it a subjective and ever-changing state of mind?

We will try to dive a bit deeper into what makes us happy and how the answer to that question varies for different groups of people. Perhaps some of the conclusions we are able to form can guide us as we stive to live healthier and happier lives in this ever-changing and challenging world.
